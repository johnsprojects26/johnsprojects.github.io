<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BIOGRAPHY<br /></span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is the album that began the fear of death and the end of time. Work began in March 2025. During this time in my life,<br />I dealt with suicide ideation. A lot was going on in my life and this album was very much so key in my growth in<br />dealing with such stress. This album doesn't really have an overarching concept,&nbsp;<br />but the general idea is clear; the want to not exist... and why that doesn't have to be the end all be all.<br />I didn't want to be generic, or wrong with my messaging. I wanted to convey something actually beautiful and honest.<br />Several of these tracks explore a specific thing, like&nbsp;<em>one arm and no luck</em> explores the life of my great grandfather who<br />unfortunately committed suicide. He had a rather unlucky life, having lost his arm and eye. old man dying of cancer explores both<br />the life of my grandfather who at the time was current dying from cancer, and a reference the political lyrical verse<br />from Pink Floyd's album Animals. the stars hallucinate hope is an abstract 20 minute song that displays the pains of the<br />beauty of life. Overall, to sum it up simply, this album is about finding meaning in life and continuing to live.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"This album gives me feelings I can't quite express, but I'll try. <br />At times, it's almost meditative, but then comes in with sounds that evoke a feeling of yearning or nostalgia, <br />lending itself to an overall journey of an experience that I'm very glad to have found. <br />Hit me harder than I was expecting, but in the best way possible.</em><em>"<br />-&nbsp;<a class="name notSkinnable" href="https://bandcamp.com/allatonce-butnot-toofast?from=fanthanks">allatonce-butnot-toofast</a></em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Beautiful.
