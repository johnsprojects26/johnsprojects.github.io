<p style="text-align: center;"> <span style="color: #008080;"><strong>ALBUM BIOGRAPHY:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #339966;">I started work on this album in september 2025 shortly after the release of release this when im dead that previous month.</span><br /><span style="color: #339966;">This album shifted towards having more centric unified overarching concept. The concept in question was influenced by personal</span><br /><span style="color: #339966;">tribulations I had dealt with, recent and old. A lot of death happened in my life at this time, most notably the death of my grandparents.</span><br /><span style="color: #339966;">In 2024, my grandmother tragically passed away, then shortly after my grandfather began his battle with cancer, to which he would</span><br /><span style="color: #339966;">eventually capitulate to around the time I was writing this album. I found their whole story captivating, two people who loved each other</span><br /><span style="color: #339966;">so dearly both dying within such a short time span... it's truly remarkable, it felt as if it were destined. Another influencing factor this album</span><br /><span style="color: #339966;">would be the persistent fear of death I have experienced throughout my whole life. I recall being very young, no older than 3, asking my mother</span><br /><span style="color: #339966;">something along the lines of "what happens after we die?" She replied with something along the lines of "we go to heaven honey". That was a</span><br /><span style="color: #339966;">good enough answer for me until age 10. I'm not sure what happened, but I slowly began to questioned it all. Long story short I became eventually<br />came to reject all religion. </span><span style="color: #339966;">Now having a lack in the traditional belief of a higher power, I was left with the terrifying fact that when we die we cease to exist. <br />Being so young, </span><span style="color: #339966;">I couldn't possibly have navigated through these thoughts, so I sat in extreme persistent denial until eventually resubscribing to religion.</span><br /><span style="color: #339966;">I slowly realized through trying to force myself to be religious that religion simply was not for me. And I slowly went back to being unsubscribed to religion.<br />Throughout being a teenage, stereotypical things have occurred with me that have occurred with many </span><span style="color: #339966;">other teenagers... I began to question things. <br />A lot of things. I went from following the American right wing political ideologies of my parents to </span><span style="color: #339966;">more non conformist and progressive views. This set up <br />the groundwork for me to requestion religion. It took a long time. Undoing the denial. So t</span><span style="color: #339966;">his album is a representation of that, <br />a representation of the acknowledgment and the acceptance of everything finite. Each track follows a different part in the fictional story I made up.<br />In fact, there really isn't a story. It's mostly up for interpretation. I didn't put too much concrete meaning into it. This album is essentially your canvas.</span><br /><span style="color: #339966;">But to put what is concrete about this album's concept into simple terms, it's about the persistent denial of death in our society, <br />and also about growing old and dying, and why that perhaps isn't a terrible thing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>MAKING PROCESS:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #339966;">As for the sound of this album, the recording process was very similar to the last. I used my iPhone microphone to record essentially everything.</span><br /><span style="color: #339966;">I primarily used the Greek Bouzouki on this album, as oppose to using an electric guitar. I used the MIDI synth in my tuner app. <br />I still wanted to maintain a distorted noisy sound, </span><span style="color: #339966;">so this album leaned <em>a ton </em>into electroacoustic. Still used audacity despite all my friends yelling at me to get a DAW.<br />Nothing fancy about the production on this one either.</span></p>
