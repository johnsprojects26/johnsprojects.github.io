<p style="text-align: center;"> <span style="color: #008080;"><strong>ALBUM BIOGRAPHY:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #339966;">This is the album that began turn around, dont drown (originally called the fear of death and the end of time). <br />Work began in March 2025. During this time in my life, </span><span style="color: #339966;">I dealt with suicidal ideation. A lot was going on in my life <br />and this album was very much so key in my growth with </span><span style="color: #339966;">dealing with that stress. This album doesn't really <br />have an overarching concept, </span><span style="color: #339966;">but the general idea is clear; the desire to not exist and why that desire doesn't have to be.<br /> </span><span style="color: #339966;">I didn't want to be generic, or wrong with my messaging. I wanted to convey something beautiful and honest.</span><br /><span style="color: #339966;">Several of these tracks explore a specific thing. these blissful days shall soon end has a basic concept about the desire for suicide,<br />one arm and no luck explores the life of my great grandfather who </span><span style="color: #339966;">unfortunately committed suicide. He had a rather unlucky life, <br />having lost his arm and eye. its like living with holding your breath is an interlude track about feeling trapped in endless stress.<br />the waves disappeared is a direct nod to the wave music scene and about a desire to not live within conformity. to isolate is a<br />breakup song, expressing disdain about the emotional nature of human beings. old man dying of cancer explores both</span><br /><span style="color: #339966;">the life of my grandfather who at the time was current dying from cancer, and a reference the political lyrical verse</span><br /><span style="color: #339966;">from Pink Floyd's album Animals. in seclusion you dreamt is the turning point in the album where hope is brought in.<br />in seclusion you dreamt is about dreaming of a better reality.  the stars hallucinate hope is the 20 minute closer song that displays <br /></span><span style="color: #339966;">raw hope about life. It displays the pain and beauty of our world. Overall, to sum it up simply, this album is about finding meaning in life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>MAKING PROCESS:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #339966;">I did not have a fancy recording set up... all I had was my iPhone for recording, a squier stratocaster, a tiny shitty fender frontman 10g,<br />and a 20 year old greek bouzouki that had been neglected for years. The mixing of this album did not take place in a DAW, it took place in<br />audacity. It got the job done. The MIDI synths on this album are from my tuner app's piano. I used different presets to get the sound I got.<br />Though this album sounds extremely jarring at times, I am nonetheless happy with how it ended up. I would rather a jarring, extreme lo-fi<br />sounding record over some overproduced polished mainstream junk. I wrote most songs on a whim. I used a lot of weird tunings, most in<br />which I've forgotten by now because they were completely unorthodox. Overall, nothing fancy went into the creation of this record, quite<br />the opposite actually. I think if any professional audio engineer / song producer read this paragrah on the inner makings of this album,<br />they'd probably rip their hair out.</span></p>
